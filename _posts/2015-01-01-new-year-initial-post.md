I have decided, as part of the new year, to track my research and make
sure that I'm not messing around too much. Lots of things on my plate
for the new year, hopefully turning a corner on things.

Again, testing out $$\LaTeX$$.

$$p(\boldsymbol y ,s \mid \boldsymbol \omega)
	= p(\boldsymbol y \mid \boldsymbol \alpha)
        \times p(s \mid \boldsymbol y; \boldsymbol \gamma)$$

This works, so I am happy. From what I can tell, math works by
inlining or not inlining $$p(\mathbf y) = p(\pmb y) = p(\boldsymbol
y)$$. Does align work?
