My name is Antonio Linero and welcome to my website! I am a graduate
student at the University of Florida. I am currently a PhD student in
the statistics at the University of Florida under the advisement of
Professors
[Mike Daniels](http://www.sbs.utexas.edu/mjdaniels/index.html) and
[Hani Doss](http://www.stat.ufl.edu/~doss/). I recieved my B.S. from
the University of Florida where I studied Finance. Some research
interests include:

1. Inference in the presence of nonignorable missing data or other
   settings which require the use of non-testable assumptions, and
   developing methods which allow one to assess sensitivity of inferences.
2. Bayesian nonparametric and semiparametric theory and practice.
3. Longitudinal data analysis.
